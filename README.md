Filter by Popularity Instead of Relevance In Woocommerce Product Search page

This code allows your woocommerce search page to filter products by popularity or best sellers instead of relevance. It works well with FiboSearch – Ajax Search for WooCommerce Plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-search-for-woocommerce).

Instructions

1. Copy the code and place it in your functions.php file of your child theme. It is recommended to place them in your child theme to avoid the code being overriden by theme updates.

2. Install FiboSearch – Ajax Search for WooCommerce Plugin, activate it, and make it your default search bar.

3. Clear any caches if you have a caching plugin installed and enjoy :).
